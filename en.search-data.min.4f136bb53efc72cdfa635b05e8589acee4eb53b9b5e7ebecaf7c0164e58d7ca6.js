Part 1 # Lets first read the task:
The Elf leads you over to the pile of colorful cards. There, you discover dozens of scratchcards, all with their opaque covering already scratched off. Picking one up, it looks like each card has two lists of numbers separated by a vertical bar (|): a list of winning numbers and then a list of numbers you have. You organize the information into a table (your puzzle input).
As far as the Elf has been able to figure out, you have to figure out which of the numbers you have appear in the list of winning numbers. The first match makes the card worth one point and each match after the first doubles the point value of that card.
For example:
Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86 6 31 17 9 48 53 Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19 Card 3: 1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14 1 Card 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58 5 54 83 Card 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36 Card 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11 In the above example, card 1 has five winning numbers (41, 48, 83, 86, and 17) and eight numbers you have (83, 86, 6, 31, 17, 9, 48, and 53). Of the numbers you have, four of them (48, 83, 17, and 86) are winning numbers! That means card 1 is worth 8 points (1 for the first match, then doubled three times for each of the three matches after the first).
Card 2 has two winning numbers (32 and 61), so it is worth 2 points. Card 3 has two winning numbers (1 and 21), so it is worth 2 points. Card 4 has one winning number (84), so it is worth 1 point. Card 5 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points. Card 6 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points. So, in this example, the Elf&rsquo;s pile of scratchcards is worth 13 points.
Take a seat in the large pile of colorful cards. How many points are they worth in total?
Loading this data is very similar to Day 2 - so let&rsquo;s load the data as we did there. Our goal is to get win and yours columns holding the respective digits which we want to compare. We find the numbers with one or more digits using the regex \\d+. And we want them to be in sets (not lists), as we can logically compare sets in Python.
import pandas as pd import re txt = pd.read_table(&#39;data/2023-12-04-1-aoc.txt&#39;, names=[&#39;win&#39;]) txt[&#39;id&#39;] = txt.loc[:, &#39;win&#39;].str.split(&#39;:&#39;).apply( lambda x: int(x[0].strip(&#39;Card &#39;))) txt[&#39;win&#39;] = (txt.loc[:, &#39;win&#39;] .str.split(&#39;:&#39;).apply(lambda x: x[1])) txt[&#39;yours&#39;] = (txt.loc[:, &#39;win&#39;] .str.split(&#39;|&#39;) .apply(lambda x: x[1]) # get a list of only the numbers / digits .apply(lambda x: re.findall(r&#39;\\d+&#39;, x)) # convert the list of strings to a set of integers .apply(lambda x: set([int(i) for i in x]))) txt[&#39;win&#39;] = (txt.loc[:, &#39;win&#39;] .str.split(&#39;|&#39;) .apply(lambda x: x[0]) .apply(lambda x: re.findall(r&#39;\\d+&#39;, x)) .apply(lambda x: set([int(i) for i in x]))) txt win id yours 0 {32, 36, 7, 9, 10, 12, 82, 85, 95, 31} 1 {2, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 21, 22, 23, 24, 31, 32, &hellip; 1 {35, 76, 16, 82, 19, 22, 88, 59, 60, 95} 2 {7, 8, 12, 16, 19, 22, 26, 28, 35, 38, 44, 51,&hellip; 2 {1, 70, 11, 78, 48, 19, 52, 88, 28, 94} 3 {3, 4, 8, 17, 18, 19, 24, 31, 34, 45, 52, 54, &hellip; 3 {65, 2, 72, 28, 14, 16, 55, 91, 92, 62} 4 {3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 15, 30, 33, 35, 47, 49, 51,&hellip; 4 {38, 41, 75, 77, 50, 24, 94, 60, 61, 30} 5 {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 17, 21, 29, 47, &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; 213 {97, 98, 39, 41, 43, 12, 13, 19, 93, 95} 214 {5, 10, 17, 20, 28, 29, 33, 34, 36, 50, 51, 52&hellip; 214 {97, 35, 69, 40, 74, 45, 20, 21, 62, 31} 215 {1, 8, 15, 17, 18, 25, 30, 33, 42, 44, 47, 52,&hellip; 215 {33, 70, 71, 12, 78, 17, 51, 86, 60, 94} 216 {7, 8, 9, 10, 22, 29, 37, 39, 41, 43, 46, 47, &hellip; 216 {98, 67, 68, 38, 70, 39, 72, 77, 45, 21} 217 {8, 21, 22, 25, 26, 31, 37, 41, 42, 48, 54, 57&hellip; 217 {34, 9, 44, 78, 79, 16, 17, 19, 55, 92} 218 {1, 4, 20, 21, 27, 38, 39, 40, 41, 45, 46, 52,&hellip; 218 rows × 3 columns
Now, we get the logical conjunction of win and yours, these are our winning numbers. Then, the number of wins is converted to points - for all number of wins bigger than 1, we can get the points by 2**(n_wins-1).
txt[&#39;n_wins&#39;] = txt.apply( lambda row: len(row.loc[&#39;win&#39;] &amp; row.loc[&#39;yours&#39;]), axis=1) txt[&#39;points&#39;] = txt.loc[:, &#39;n_wins&#39;].apply( lambda x: 2**(x-1) if x &gt; 1 else x) txt.loc[:, [&#39;win&#39;, &#39;n_wins&#39;, &#39;points&#39;]] win n_wins points 0 {32, 36, 7, 9, 10, 12, 82, 85, 95, 31} 10 512 1 {35, 76, 16, 82, 19, 22, 88, 59, 60, 95} 10 512 2 {1, 70, 11, 78, 48, 19, 52, 88, 28, 94} 5 16 3 {65, 2, 72, 28, 14, 16, 55, 91, 92, 62} 0 0 4 {38, 41, 75, 77, 50, 24, 94, 60, 61, 30} 0 0 &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; 213 {97, 98, 39, 41, 43, 12, 13, 19, 93, 95} 0 0 214 {97, 35, 69, 40, 74, 45, 20, 21, 62, 31} 0 0 215 {33, 70, 71, 12, 78, 17, 51, 86, 60, 94} 2 2 216 {98, 67, 68, 38, 70, 39, 72, 77, 45, 21} 1 1 217 {34, 9, 44, 78, 79, 16, 17, 19, 55, 92} 0 0 218 rows × 3 columns
Then, we just sum up:
Reveal solution! sum(txt.loc[:, &#39;points&#39;]) 25004 Part 2 # There&rsquo;s no such thing as &ldquo;points&rdquo;. Instead, scratchcards only cause you to win more scratchcards equal to the number of winning numbers you have.
Specifically, you win copies of the scratchcards below the winning card equal to the number of matches. So, if card 10 were to have 5 matching numbers, you would win one copy each of cards 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.
Copies of scratchcards are scored like normal scratchcards and have the same card number as the card they copied. So, if you win a copy of card 10 and it has 5 matching numbers, it would then win a copy of the same cards that the original card 10 won: cards 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. This process repeats until none of the copies cause you to win any more cards. (Cards will never make you copy a card past the end of the table.)
This time, the above example goes differently:
Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86 6 31 17 9 48 53 Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19 Card 3: 1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14 1 Card 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58 5 54 83 Card 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36 Card 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11 Card 1 has four matching numbers, so you win one copy each of the next four cards: cards 2, 3, 4, and 5. Your original card 2 has two matching numbers, so you win one copy each of cards 3 and 4. Your copy of card 2 also wins one copy each of cards 3 and 4. Your four instances of card 3 (one original and three copies) have two matching numbers, so you win four copies each of cards 4 and 5. Your eight instances of card 4 (one original and seven copies) have one matching number, so you win eight copies of card 5. Your fourteen instances of card 5 (one original and thirteen copies) have no matching numbers and win no more cards. Once all of the originals and copies have been processed, you end up with 1 instance of card 1, 2 instances of card 2, 4 instances of card 3, 8 instances of card 4, 14 instances of card 5, and 1 instance of card 6. In total, this example pile of scratchcards causes you to ultimately have 30 scratchcards!
Process all of the original and copied scratchcards until no more scratchcards are won. Including the original set of scratchcards, how many total scratchcards do you end up with?
We will use the n_wins column we created before and go from there. We step through each Game. Each current game gets +1 card. Then, we step through the number of next games depending on our n_wins. Each of these gets added the card number of the current game.
txt[&#39;cards&#39;] = 0 for i, nwin in enumerate(txt.loc[:, &#39;n_wins&#39;]): txt.loc[i, &#39;cards&#39;] += 1 for j in range(1, nwin+1): txt.loc[i+j, &#39;cards&#39;] += txt.loc[i, &#39;cards&#39;] txt.loc[:, [&#39;n_wins&#39;, &#39;cards&#39;]] n_wins cards 0 10 1 1 10 2 2 5 4 3 0 8 4 0 8 &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; 213 0 9608 214 0 8927 215 2 8927 216 1 12636 217 0 21564 218 rows × 2 columns
Now, we just sum the output again:

Part 1 # Lets first read the task:
The engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you don&rsquo;t really understand, but apparently any number adjacent to a symbol, even diagonally, is a &ldquo;part number&rdquo; and should be included in your sum. (Periods (.) do not count as a symbol.)
Here is an example engine schematic:
467..114.. ...*...... ..35..633. ......#... 617*...... .....+.58. ..592..... ......755. ...$.*.... .664.598.. In this schematic, two numbers are not part numbers because they are not adjacent to a symbol: 114 (top right) and 58 (middle right). Every other number is adjacent to a symbol and so is a part number; their sum is 4361.
Of course, the actual engine schematic is much larger. What is the sum of all of the part numbers in the engine schematic?
Okay, let&rsquo;s first get the input as a numpy character array
import numpy as np import pandas as pd import sys import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from scipy import ndimage as ndi np.set_printoptions(threshold=sys.maxsize) txt = pd.read_table(&#39;data/2023-12-03-1-aoc.txt&#39;, names=[&#39;code&#39;]) arr = np.chararray((txt.size, txt.size), unicode=True) txt[&#39;code&#39;] = txt.loc[:, &#39;code&#39;].apply(lambda x: [i for i in x]) for i, code in enumerate(txt[&#39;code&#39;]): arr[i, :] = code print((arr[:15, :15])) [[&#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39;] [&#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;5&#39; &#39;3&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;4&#39;] [&#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;*&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39;] [&#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;7&#39; &#39;2&#39; &#39;6&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39;] [&#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;9&#39; &#39;5&#39;] [&#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;7&#39; &#39;3&#39; &#39;8&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;*&#39; &#39;.&#39;] [&#39;.&#39; &#39;7&#39; &#39;4&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;3&#39; &#39;6&#39; &#39;6&#39;] [&#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;*&#39; &#39;1&#39; &#39;2&#39; &#39;6&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39;] [&#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;3&#39; &#39;3&#39; &#39;1&#39; &#39;/&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;9&#39;] [&#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;/&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;*&#39;] [&#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;9&#39; &#39;5&#39; &#39;3&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;3&#39; &#39;5&#39; &#39;5&#39; &#39;.&#39;] [&#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39;] [&#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39;] [&#39;.&#39; &#39;6&#39; &#39;8&#39; &#39;5&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;*&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;7&#39; &#39;0&#39;] [&#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;9&#39; &#39;3&#39; &#39;8&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;.&#39; &#39;*&#39;]] Now extract symbols, digits and the empty space. We use the numpy character methods for that. This way, we create a binary mask for all digits and a binary mask for all empty space (.). The symbols are then every character which is neither.
digits = np.char.isdigit(arr) empty = np.char.endswith(arr, &#39;.&#39;) symbols = ~(digits | empty) # just for visualization plt.figure(figsize=(16, 5)) plt.subplot(131, title=&#39;symbols&#39;).matshow(symbols) plt.subplot(132, title=&#39;digits&#39;).matshow(digits) plt.subplot(133, title=&#39;empty&#39;).matshow(empty) plt.show() Now we use the image processing technique of dilation on the symbols mask. So that we get a new mask which covers the surroundings of all symbols. We use this afterwards to check if the digits are near a symbol.
struct = ((1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1)) dilate = ndi.binary_dilation(symbols, structure=struct) plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) plt.subplot(121, title=&#39;symbols&#39;).matshow(symbols[:15, :15]) plt.subplot(122, title=&#39;symbols dilated&#39;).matshow(dilate[:15, :15]) plt.show() Creating this masks as before could be understood as a binary segmentation, as each element in our mask is either True or False. To extract the single digits, we&rsquo;ll convert the binary digits segmentation into a instance segmentation, where each connected segment has an own index.
markers, num_features = ndi.label(digits) plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) plt.subplot(121, title=&#39;binary segmentation&#39;).matshow( digits[:15, :15]) plt.subplot(122, title=&#39;instance segmentation&#39;).matshow( markers[:15, :15], cmap=&#39;gnuplot&#39;) plt.show() Now, for each instance, we check if the dilated binary mask overlaps with the instance and if yes, we extract the number.
numbers = [int(&#39;&#39;.join(arr[markers == i])) for i in range(1, num_features+1) if np.any((markers == i) &amp; dilate)] Then, we just sum up:
Reveal solution! sum(numbers) 527364 Part 2 # The missing part wasn&rsquo;t the only issue - one of the gears in the engine is wrong. A gear is any * symbol that is adjacent to exactly two part numbers. Its gear ratio is the result of multiplying those two numbers together.
This time, you need to find the gear ratio of every gear and add them all up so that the engineer can figure out which gear needs to be replaced.
Consider the same engine schematic again:The missing part wasn&rsquo;t the only issue - one of the gears in the engine is wrong. A gear is any * symbol that is adjacent to exactly two part numbers. Its gear ratio is the result of multiplying those two numbers together.
This time, you need to find the gear ratio of every gear and add them all up so that the engineer can figure out which gear needs to be replaced.
Consider the same engine schematic again:
467..114.. ...*...... ..35..633. ......#... 617*...... .....+.58. ..592..... ......755. ...$.*.... .664.598.. In this schematic, there are two gears. The first is in the top left; it has part numbers 467 and 35, so its gear ratio is 16345. The second gear is in the lower right; its gear ratio is 451490. (The * adjacent to 617 is not a gear because it is only adjacent to one part number.) Adding up all of the gear ratios produces 467835.
What is the sum of all of the gear ratios in your engine schematic?
We&rsquo;ll use the same method as before, but this time only extract * and create the instance segmentation before the dilation. Why? Because when we dilate first, we could merge two independent gears into one instance.
gear = np.char.endswith(arr, &#39;*&#39;) gear_markers, gear_num = ndi.label(gear) plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) plt.subplot(131, title=&#39;all symbols dilated&#39;).matshow( symbols[:15, :15]) plt.subplot(132, title=&#39;gears&#39;).matshow( gear[:15, :15]) plt.subplot(133, title=&#39;gears instances&#39;).matshow( gear_markers[:15, :15], cmap=&#39;gnuplot&#39;) plt.show() Now, we step through each gear instance, create a mask for that gear, dilate it, and then step through all digits and check if they are in the gear mask. If we get two digits in the end, we multiply them to get the dear ratio and save the ratios to a list.
gear_ratios = [] for i in range(1, gear_num+1): gear_binary = gear_markers == i gear_dil = ndi.binary_dilation(gear_binary, structure=struct) part_numbers = [int(&#39;&#39;.join(arr[markers == j])) for j in range(1, num_features+1) if np.any((markers == j) &amp; gear_dil)] if len(part_numbers) == 2: gear_ratios.append(part_numbers[0] * part_numbers[1]) Now, we just sum the output again:

Cautious,
like fearing four neighbors
Solemn,
like a guest
Loose,
like ice about to melt
Genuine,
like plain wood
Open,
like a valley
Opaque,
like muddy water
Who can be muddled yet desist
In stillness gradually become clear?
Who can be serene yet persist
In motion gradually come alive?
One who holds this &lt;i&gt;Tao&lt;/i&gt; does not wish to be overfilled
Because one is not overfilled
Therefore one can preserve and not create anew
Dàodéjīng - Chapter 20 (Being different from ordinary people) Cease learning, no more worries
Respectful response and scornful response
How much is the difference?
Goodness and evil
How much do they differ?
What the people fear,
I cannot be unafraid
So desolate! How limitless it is!
The people are excited
As if enjoying a great feast
As if climbing up to the terrace in spring
I alone am quiet and uninvolved
Like an infant
not yet smiling
So weary,
like having no place to return
The people all have surplus
While I alone seem lacking
I have the heart of a fool indeed -
so ignorant!
Ordinary people are bright
I alone am muddled
Ordinary people are scrutinizing
I alone am obtuse
So tranquil, like the ocean
So moving, as if without limits
The people all have goals
And I alone am stubborn and lowly
I alone am different from them
And value the nourishing mother

Part 1 # Lets first read the task:
As you walk, the Elf shows you a small bag and some cubes which are either red, green, or blue. Each time you play this game, he will hide a secret number of cubes of each color in the bag, and your goal is to figure out information about the number of cubes.
To get information, once a bag has been loaded with cubes, the Elf will reach into the bag, grab a handful of random cubes, show them to you, and then put them back in the bag. He&rsquo;ll do this a few times per game.
You play several games and record the information from each game (your puzzle input). Each game is listed with its ID number (like the 11 in Game 11: ...) followed by a semicolon-separated list of subsets of cubes that were revealed from the bag (like 3 red, 5 green, 4 blue).
For example, the record of a few games might look like this:
Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green In game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put back again). The first set is 3 blue cubes and 4 red cubes; the second set is 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes; the third set is only 2 green cubes.
The Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag contained only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes?
In the example above, games 1, 2, and 5 would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with that configuration. However, game 3 would have been impossible because at one point the Elf showed you 20 red cubes at once; similarly, game 4 would also have been impossible because the Elf showed you 15 blue cubes at once. If you add up the IDs of the games that would have been possible, you get 8.
Determine which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes. What is the sum of the IDs of those games?
Okay, let&rsquo;s load our python kernel in emacs-jupyter and get coding! First of all, let&rsquo;s load the input and split the riddle code by colon : to extract the game id and the rest of the code by semicolon ; to get the number of sets played in each game.
import pandas as pd import re txt = pd.read_table(&#39;data/2023-12-02-1-aoc.txt&#39;, names=[&#39;code&#39;]) txt[&#39;id&#39;] = txt.loc[:, &#39;code&#39;].str.split(&#39;:&#39;).apply( lambda x: int(x[0].strip(&#39;Game &#39;))) txt[&#39;code&#39;] = txt.loc[:, &#39;code&#39;].str.split(&#39;:&#39;).apply(lambda x: x[1]) # txt[&#39;code&#39;] = txt.loc[:, &#39;code&#39;].str.split(&#39;;&#39;) # txt[&#39;nsets&#39;] = txt.loc[:, &#39;code&#39;].apply(lambda x: len(x)) txt code id 0 1 green, 1 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 8 red, 7 blu... 1 1 9 red, 7 green, 3 blue; 15 green, 2 blue, 5 r... 2 2 3 red, 1 blue, 4 green; 6 red, 3 green, 2 blu... 3 3 2 blue, 2 green, 19 red; 3 blue, 11 red, 16 g... 4 4 8 green, 1 red, 12 blue; 10 green, 6 red, 13 ... 5 .. ... ... 95 2 red, 2 green, 1 blue; 1 red, 4 green; 1 green 96 96 4 red, 5 green; 5 blue, 3 red; 8 blue, 2 gree... 97 97 1 blue; 2 green, 1 red; 5 red, 2 green; 4 red... 98 98 6 blue, 5 red, 2 green; 9 red, 1 blue; 2 gree... 99 99 1 blue, 13 green, 14 red; 11 green, 11 blue, ... 100 [100 rows x 2 columns] Now, let&rsquo;s extract the three colors in different columns with regex. We use the lookahead assertion ?= to find the respective colours and only exctract the digits \\d+ coming before. Then we just keep the max imum drawn number of cubes per color, since this is the only information that matters at the moment.
txt[&#39;green&#39;] = txt.loc[:, &#39;code&#39;].apply( lambda code: re.findall(r&#39;\\d+(?=.green)&#39;, code)).apply( lambda list: max([int(i) for i in list])) txt[&#39;red&#39;] = txt.loc[:, &#39;code&#39;].apply( lambda code: re.findall(r&#39;\\d+(?=.red)&#39;, code)).apply( lambda list: max([int(i) for i in list])) txt[&#39;blue&#39;] = txt.loc[:, &#39;code&#39;].apply( lambda code: re.findall(r&#39;\\d+(?=.blue)&#39;, code)).apply( lambda list: max([int(i) for i in list])) txt code id green red blue 0 1 green, 1 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 8 red, 7 blu... 1 2 10 10 1 9 red, 7 green, 3 blue; 15 green, 2 blue, 5 r... 2 15 10 3 2 3 red, 1 blue, 4 green; 6 red, 3 green, 2 blu... 3 4 6 16 3 2 blue, 2 green, 19 red; 3 blue, 11 red, 16 g... 4 16 20 18 4 8 green, 1 red, 12 blue; 10 green, 6 red, 13 ... 5 10 6 14 .. ... ... ... ... ... 95 2 red, 2 green, 1 blue; 1 red, 4 green; 1 green 96 4 2 1 96 4 red, 5 green; 5 blue, 3 red; 8 blue, 2 gree... 97 5 4 8 97 1 blue; 2 green, 1 red; 5 red, 2 green; 4 red... 98 2 5 2 98 6 blue, 5 red, 2 green; 9 red, 1 blue; 2 gree... 99 2 9 11 99 1 blue, 13 green, 14 red; 11 green, 11 blue, ... 100 13 15 11 [100 rows x 5 columns] Lastly, we just filter the DataFrame to only include games where all drawn cubes were below or equal the number of cubes in the game and sum the result!
txt[&#39;id&#39;][(txt[&#39;green&#39;] &lt; 14) &amp; (txt[&#39;red&#39;] &lt; 13) &amp; (txt[&#39;blue&#39;] &lt; 15)].sum() 3035 Part 2 # First, let&rsquo;s get the instruction from the second part:
As you continue your walk, the Elf poses a second question: in each game you played, what is the fewest number of cubes of each color that could have been in the bag to make the game possible?
Again consider the example games from earlier:
Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green In game 1, the game could have been played with as few as 4 red, 2 green, and 6 blue cubes. If any color had even one fewer cube, the game would have been impossible. Game 2 could have been played with a minimum of 1 red, 3 green, and 4 blue cubes. Game 3 must have been played with at least 20 red, 13 green, and 6 blue cubes. Game 4 required at least 14 red, 3 green, and 15 blue cubes. Game 5 needed no fewer than 6 red, 3 green, and 2 blue cubes in the bag. The power of a set of cubes is equal to the numbers of red, green, and blue cubes multiplied together. The power of the minimum set of cubes in game 1 is 48. In games 2-5 it was 12, 1560, 630, and 36, respectively. Adding up these five powers produces the sum 2286.
For each game, find the minimum set of cubes that must have been present. What is the sum of the power of these sets?
Luckily, this task is made trivial by the approach we have taken before. We just have to multiply the green, red and blue columns:
txt[&#39;power&#39;] = txt.loc[:, &#39;green&#39;] * txt.loc[:, &#39;blue&#39;] * txt.loc[:, &#39;red&#39;] txt code id green red blue \\ 0 1 green, 1 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 8 red, 7 blu... 1 2 10 10 1 9 red, 7 green, 3 blue; 15 green, 2 blue, 5 r... 2 15 10 3 2 3 red, 1 blue, 4 green; 6 red, 3 green, 2 blu... 3 4 6 16 3 2 blue, 2 green, 19 red; 3 blue, 11 red, 16 g... 4 16 20 18 4 8 green, 1 red, 12 blue; 10 green, 6 red, 13 ... 5 10 6 14 .. ... ... ... ... ... 95 2 red, 2 green, 1 blue; 1 red, 4 green; 1 green 96 4 2 1 96 4 red, 5 green; 5 blue, 3 red; 8 blue, 2 gree... 97 5 4 8 97 1 blue; 2 green, 1 red; 5 red, 2 green; 4 red... 98 2 5 2 98 6 blue, 5 red, 2 green; 9 red, 1 blue; 2 gree... 99 2 9 11 99 1 blue, 13 green, 14 red; 11 green, 11 blue, ... 100 13 15 11 power 0 200 1 450 2 384 3 5760 4 840 .. ... 95 8 96 160 97 20 98 198 99 2145 [100 rows x 6 columns] And for this one, the sum is:

Part 1 # Our first task is the following:
The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.
For example:
1abc2 pqr3stu8vwx a1b2c3d4e5f treb7uchet In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.
Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
Lets start jupyter in our shell to start coding!
conda activate tf jupyter lab --no-browser --port=8888 First, load the test document
import pandas as pd import re txt = pd.read_table(&#39;data/2023-12-01-1-aoc.txt&#39;, names=[&#39;code&#39;]) txt code 0 jjfvnnlfivejj1 1 6fourfour 2 ninevbmltwo69 3 pcg91vqrfpxxzzzoneightzt 4 jpprthxgjfive3one1qckhrptpqdc .. ... 995 583sevenhjxlqzjgbzxhkcl5 996 81s 997 2four3threesxxvlfqfive4 998 nine6eightsevenzx9twoxc 999 hmbfjdfnp989mfivefiverpzrjs [1000 rows x 1 columns] Second, extract the digits. I had to wrap my head around regex matching in python first, because I first tried pandas.extract (which only extracts the first match), then pandas.extractall (which extracts all matches but puts them into a multiindex which makes things more difficult in this case). So I settled for the re.findall version, which returns a list. To concatenate the elements in the list, we take use the join function.
txt[&#39;digits&#39;] = txt.loc[:, &#39;code&#39;].apply( lambda x: &#39;&#39;.join(re.findall(r&#39;(\\d+)&#39;, x))) txt code digits 0 jjfvnnlfivejj1 1 1 6fourfour 6 2 ninevbmltwo69 69 3 pcg91vqrfpxxzzzoneightzt 91 4 jpprthxgjfive3one1qckhrptpqdc 31 .. ... ... 995 583sevenhjxlqzjgbzxhkcl5 5835 996 81s 81 997 2four3threesxxvlfqfive4 234 998 nine6eightsevenzx9twoxc 69 999 hmbfjdfnp989mfivefiverpzrjs 989 [1000 rows x 2 columns] Next, combine the first and the last digit and convert the result from string to integer

txt.loc[:, &#39;calibration&#39;].sum() 56465 Part 2 # Now follows part two:
Your calculation isn&rsquo;t quite right. It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled out with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid &ldquo;digits&rdquo;.
Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line. For example:
two1nine eightwothree abcone2threexyz xtwone3four 4nineeightseven2 zoneight234 7pqrstsixteen In this example, the calibration values are 29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76. Adding these together produces 281.
What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
Okay, let&rsquo;s see if we can update the pattern matching. To deal with potential overlapping values like oneight which contains one as well as eight, I used the regex positive lookahead ?= as described here. Because this enables capturing overlapping values, I used \\d (one digit) instead of \\d+ (one or more digits), otherwise digits might double. Afterwards, just replace the spelled out digits with their numerical value.
# for i, r in enumerate(txt.loc[:, &#39;code&#39;]): # matches = re.findall( # r&#39;(?=(\\d|one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine))&#39;, r) # result = &#39;&#39;.join([match for match in matches]) # result = result.replace(&#39;one&#39;, &#39;1&#39;).replace(&#39;two&#39;, &#39;2&#39;).replace( # &#39;three&#39;, &#39;3&#39;).replace(&#39;four&#39;, &#39;4&#39;).replace(&#39;five&#39;, &#39;5&#39;).replace( # &#39;six&#39;, &#39;6&#39;).replace(&#39;seven&#39;, &#39;7&#39;).replace(&#39;eight&#39;, &#39;8&#39;).replace( # &#39;nine&#39;, &#39;9&#39;) # txt.loc[i, &#39;digits2&#39;] = result # txt # a very nice alternative suggested by Tomalak: digits = &#39;\\d one two three four five six seven eight nine&#39;.split() txt[&#39;digits2&#39;] = txt.loc[:, &#39;code&#39;].apply(lambda v: &#39;&#39;.join( str(digits.index(m)) if m in digits else m for m in re.findall(rf&#39;(?=({&#34;|&#34;.join(digits)}))&#39;, v) )) txt code digits calibration digits2 0 jjfvnnlfivejj1 1 11 51 1 6fourfour 6 66 644 2 ninevbmltwo69 69 69 9269 3 pcg91vqrfpxxzzzoneightzt 91 91 9118 4 jpprthxgjfive3one1qckhrptpqdc 31 31 5311 .. ... ... ... ... 995 583sevenhjxlqzjgbzxhkcl5 5835 55 58375 996 81s 81 81 81 997 2four3threesxxvlfqfive4 234 24 243354 998 nine6eightsevenzx9twoxc 69 69 968792 999 hmbfjdfnp989mfivefiverpzrjs 989 99 98955 [1000 rows x 4 columns] Now, construct the calibration value as before&hellip;
