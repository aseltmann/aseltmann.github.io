Dàodéjīng - Chapter 11 (The use of what has no substantive existence) [&hellip;]
Mix clay
to create a container
In its emptiness, there is
the function of a container
[&hellip;]
Therefore,
that which exists is used to create benefit
That which is empty is used to create functionality
Dàodéjīng - Chapter 15 (The exhibition of the qualities of the Dao) The Tao masters of antiquity
Subtle wonders through mystery
Depths that cannot be discerned
Because one cannot discern them
Therefore one is forced to describe the appearance
Hesitant,
like crossing a wintry river
Cautious,
like fearing four neighbors
Solemn,
like a guest
Loose,
like ice about to melt
Genuine,
like plain wood
Open,
like a valley
Opaque,
like muddy water
Who can be muddled yet desist
In stillness gradually become clear?
Who can be serene yet persist
In motion gradually come alive?
One who holds this &lt;i&gt;Tao&lt;/i&gt; does not wish to be overfilled
Because one is not overfilled
Therefore one can preserve and not create anew
Dàodéjīng - Chapter 20 (Being different from ordinary people) Cease learning, no more worries
Respectful response and scornful response
How much is the difference?
Goodness and evil
How much do they differ?
What the people fear,
I cannot be unafraid
So desolate! How limitless it is!
The people are excited
As if enjoying a great feast
As if climbing up to the terrace in spring
I alone am quiet and uninvolved
Like an infant
not yet smiling
So weary,
like having no place to return
The people all have surplus
While I alone seem lacking
I have the heart of a fool indeed -
so ignorant!
Ordinary people are bright
I alone am muddled
Ordinary people are scrutinizing
I alone am obtuse
So tranquil, like the ocean
So moving, as if without limits
The people all have goals
And I alone am stubborn and lowly
I alone am different from them
And value the nourishing mother

Thus, I am currently working on a reproducible way of conducting my research on simulation of Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) measurements and correcting artifacts using neural networks, such as Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs). I do not have my workflow fixed yet, but to have an insight in my current approach - and with the principles of Open-notebook science in mind:
Fluotracify - doctoral research project done in a reproducible way
Description: In a current project, we apply Deep Learning techniques on Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) data to correct a variety of hardware- and sample-related artifacts, such as photobleaching, contamination from additional slow moving particles, or sudden drops in intensity because of detector anomalies.
